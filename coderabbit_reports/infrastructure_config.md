Prompt for AI Agent:
In @coderabbit_reports/infrastructure_config.md around lines 1 - 3, The file infrastructure_config.md currently contains only a placeholder and should either be completed with the intended infrastructure configuration documentation or removed if it was committed by mistake; update the file (infrastructure_config.md) to include the required infrastructure details (e.g., environment variables, provisioning steps, cloud resources, network/security config, and any deployment commands) or delete the file and remove it from the commit, then run the repo checks/CI to ensure no references break.
